# BounderR_CCF
Cross-correlation function analysis of filopodia dynamics and tip fluorescence, using hierarchical clustering to identify subgroups of filopodia exhibiting similar behaviour.

This script is part of a suite of scripts for analysis of filopodia dynamics using the Fiji plugin Bounder. The question addressed within this script are whether the accummulation of protein of interest (measured by protein fluorescence intensity) inside the tips of filopodia correlates with their behaviour (this may differ between different filopodia). An effect of protein accumulation may occur either immediately (offset = 0) or with a delay (offset > 0) if the protein requires time to activate other downstream effectors before exerting its effect on tip movement. For this reason we used a cross-correlation function to compute the correlation (for each filopodium) between fluorescence and movement at each value of the offset. We then looked at groups of filopodia that share a similar relationship between fluorescence and movement (responding vs non-responding filopodia) using hierarchical clustering, and compared the properties of those clusters.
